# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients: unexpected color transitions or missing styles.  The gradient may not apply correctly, appear incomplete, or produce unexpected color shifts.

## Problem
The provided HTML utilizes Tailwind CSS's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility to create a radial gradient. However, under certain conditions (specific browser versions, CSS conflicts), this gradient may not render as expected, displaying incorrect color transitions or missing parts of the gradient.

## Solution
The solution involves double-checking the Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure gradients are correctly configured and included in the build.  Additionally, resolving any CSS conflicts that may override or interfere with the gradient's styles can resolve the issue.  In some cases, explicitly specifying the gradient's `background-image` property using CSS may be necessary as a workaround.
